## **Summary Table: Similarity & Difference**

- **Similarity**
  - Both use Python and popular ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace).
  - Both require GPUs for efficient LLM training.
  - Data processing, training, and evaluation steps are conceptually similar.
  - Both can use REST APIs or containers for model deployment.
  - Both rely on good code, data, and model management.

- **Differences**
  - **Resource Management:** AWS provides elastic, managed, and on-demand resources; local is fixed and manual.
  - **Scalability:** AWS scales instantly and globally; local scaling requires hardware investment and setup.
  - **Cost Model:** AWS is pay-as-you-go, local is up-front investment.
  - **Security & Collaboration:** AWS has managed IAM, encryption, and sharing; local is manual.
  - **Automation:** AWS offers managed automation for tuning, training, monitoring; local is mostly manual.
  - **Integration:** AWS integrates with many services (S3, Lambda, Step Functions, etc.) easily.
  - **Monitoring & Logging:** AWS has built-in, scalable solutions; local often requires extra setup.
